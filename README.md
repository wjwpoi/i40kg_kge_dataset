# i40kg_kge_dataset
I40KG is a publicly available Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) dataset derived from the industrial production domain, introduced in our paper "Interleaving and Cross-Attention Presents Efficient Knowledge Graph Embedding" (Wu et al., 2025).

The raw data originate from the benchmark study "A Benchmark Dataset with Knowledge Graph Generation for Industry 4.0 Production Lines" (Yahya et al., 2024). We have carefully preprocessed and structured this data into a practical KGE dataset, making it suitable for training and evaluating embedding models on real-world industrial relational data.

This dataset is intended to support research in knowledge graph completion, link prediction, and related embedding tasks, providing a realistic use case from the Industry 4.0 environment.

For detailed information regarding dataset construction, statistics, and experimental results, please refer to our paper. If you use this dataset in your work, we kindly encourage you to cite both the original data source (Yahya et al., 2024) and our paper (Wu et al., 2025).

If you find this dataset helpful for your research, please consider giving it a star ⭐️!
