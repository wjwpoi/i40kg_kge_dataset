# I40KG KGE Dataset
**I40KG** is a publicly available Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) dataset derived from the industrial production domain. It was first introduced in our paper: ***“Interleaving and Cross-Attention Presents Efficient Knowledge Graph Embedding”*** (Wu et al., 2025).

The raw data originates from the benchmark study: ***“A Benchmark Dataset with Knowledge Graph Generation for Industry 4.0 Production Lines”*** (Yahya et al., 2024). We have carefully preprocessed and structured this data into a practical KGE dataset, making it suitable for training and evaluating KGE models on real-world industrial relational data.

This dataset is intended to support research in knowledge graph completion, link prediction, and related embedding tasks, providing a realistic use case from the Industry 4.0 environment.

For detailed information regarding dataset construction, statistics, and experimental results, please refer to our paper. If you use this dataset in your work, we kindly request that you cite both the original data source (Yahya et al., 2024) and our paper (Wu et al., 2025).
